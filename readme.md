A collaborative project with [AdrianFoo97](https://github.com/AdrianFoo97) for the course BIT216 Software Engineering Principles at HELP University, Malaysia. The Jinjang Utara Community Project was one of HELP Universityâ€™s Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) projects under the Jinjang Literacy and Numeracy Projects. Our project goal was to apply the principles of software engineering to create an e-business website for the Jinjang community which we named the Jinjang Empowerment E-business (JEE). 

Similar to the course BIT210 Web Programming for the [HELPFit](https://github.com/thecelineteh/HELPFit) case study project which I collaborated with [Daenise](https://github.com/Daenise), the following coding platforms/languages are used:
* HTML5
* CSS
* Bootstrap 
* JavaScript
* PHP
* MySQL
* XAMPP (local server)
